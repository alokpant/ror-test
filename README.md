# Elias' struggle with RoR

The main purpose of this project is for me to get into ruby on rails. To achieve this, I recreate the classic [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) in said environment. Let's see how that works out.

## Things I want to achieve:
- [x] Creating  tasks
- [x] Editing tasks
  - [x] in Edit-form
  - [x] marking tasks as done/undone inline
  - [x] changing description inline
- [x] Deleting tasks
- [x] Listing existing tasks
- [x] Filtering List of tasks
- [ ] Deleting done tasks
- [ ] Styling

*Default ToDoMVC until here*

- [ ] Nice Transitions
- [ ] Localization
- [ ] User-Management
  - [ ] User Login
  - [ ] Different Task-sets for different Users
  - [ ] Different rights i.e. Admin can manage all users, ordinary user can't
