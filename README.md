# Elias' struggle with RoR

The main purpose of this project is for me to get into ruby on rails. To achieve this, I recreate the classic [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) in said environment. Let's see how that works out.

## Ruby version
2.5.1

## *System dependencies*  
Not yet researched

## *Configuration*
No need to configure a thing right now

## Database creation
To create the database you have to run `rake db:create`

## Database initialization
To initialize the database you have to run `rake db:migrate`

## *How to run the test suite*
Not yet done

## *Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)*
Not yet done, and maybe not needed

## *Deployment instructions*
